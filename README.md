##  "What is the weather like as we approach the equator?"

### Summary of findings
-	As we get farther away north or south from the equator, the temperature drops. 
-	In the Northern hemisphere 69% of the variability in temperature can be explained by latitude. Also, there is a negative correlation between latitude and temperature. 
-	In the Southern hemisphere 24% of the variability in temperature can be explained by latitude. Also, there is a positive correlation between latitude and temperature.
-	R-squared in the Northern hemisphere is 0.17 and in the Southern hemisphere is 0.07. Both values are close to zero therefore latitude does not explain much of the variability in humidity, suggesting a poor fit of the model.
-	R-squared in the Northern hemisphere is 0.07 and in the Southern hemisphere is 0.12. Both values are close to zero therefore latitude does not explain much of the variability in cloudiness, suggesting a poor fit of the model.
-	R-squared in the Northern hemisphere is 0.005 and in the Southern hemisphere is 0.096. Both values are close to zero therefore latitude does not explain much of the variability in wind speed, suggesting a poor fit of the model.
